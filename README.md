# Queens

This repository contains a Rust project designed to brute-force solve the LinkedIn Queens game.

The LinkedIn Queens game is a puzzle where you must place 8 queens on a chessboard-like grid. The catch is that the board is divided into colored regions, and you must place exactly one queen in each of the 8 regions. Like in chess, no two queens can attack each other, meaning they cannot share the same row or column.

This project provides a library for modeling the game and searching for solutions.
